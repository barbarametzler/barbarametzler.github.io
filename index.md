I'm a PhD student at Imperial College London and member of the [Global Environmental Health Research Group](http://globalenvhealth.org/) and the [Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities](http://equitablehealthycities.org/) collaboration. My research focuses on analysing urban development with high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning in Sub-Saharan Africa.
