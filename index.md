I'm a Research Associate with the [Science of Cities and Regions group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/science-cities-and-regions) at the Alan Turing Institute. I'm interested in people, data and foundation models - currently thinking about foundation models in GeoAI.

Recent projects as part of the Alan Turing Institute:
- [Are you smarter than a foundation model? (Online game)](https://are-you-smarter-than-a-foundational-model.vercel.app/)
- [DemoLand](https://urban-analytics-technology-platform.github.io/demoland-web/tyne_and_wear/)
- [EuroFab](https://eurofab-project.github.io/)


Before joining the Alan Turing Institute, I obtained my PhD at Imperial College London as part of the [Global Environmental Health Research Group](http://globalenvhealth.org/) and the [Pathways to Equitable Healthy Cities](http://equitablehealthycities.org/) collaboration. My PhD research focussed on characterising urban development with high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning in Sub-Saharan Africa.
